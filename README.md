An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test used to detect abnormalities related to electrical activity of the brain. This program is designed for use with the consumer grade headset NeuroSky MindWave.
This program graphs the recorded data as shown below. Throughout the duration of your test, you can enter comments to help see how specific aspects of your test impact the recorded brain waves. In the graph below, you can see that I made a comment saying I'm about to do math problems, and immediately following that comment we see a large deviation in the Red and Blue lines.
